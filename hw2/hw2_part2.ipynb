    "Having knowledge from lectures and having done some googling I decided that I have three main ways to try: ResNet-like architectures, DenseNet (actually, improvement of ResNet in a sense) and VGG-like architectures. From the coursemates I've heard a lot of their result with model with residual connections and many achieve good accuracy scores (~30%) within several epochs (like 10 or even less), but I was more interested to train something similar to VGG, because it was not interesting enough for me to do the same as others do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly I've tried just to download the model and try to train it as is (only changing the last FC layer, because we have different number of classes here), but I quickly stopped attemts. The main reason was that an epoch took like 100+ seconds on GPU and accuracy didn't change much. Actually, it not only didn't change, but it also stayed near $1 / 200$, which means random predictions and absence of learning. So I've built a model TonyNet, in which I took first 16 layers of `features` part of VGG16 and trained it. The motivation was to keep the structure of architecture of the model (that is known to perform good on ImageNet), but slightly reduce the number of parameters to quicken the learning procedure. From the very first moment I used several augmentation techniques like random croppin, horizontal flips, rotation and color jittering and Adam optimizer, because I knew the learning procedure will take long (mostly because of the skip connections absence) and I won't be able to perform all experiment inserting one trick at a time. After several attempts I was still having a random prediction, so I decided to get rid of weight decay (I used it from the beggining to avoid possible overfit). Finally I've managed to find a learning rate (appears that was the initalial problem) that actually made accuracy increase. Funny but `1e-3` is a LR wich doesn't make model to learn at all, but `1e-4` does the job. After several expreiments I've chosen LR in between that still gave some results. The I had an idea that 16 layers of convolutions and poolings will be not enough, so I took 24 first layers of VGG and left others as is (of course tuning first and last FC layers dimentions accordingly).\n",
    "\n",
    "A took a batchsize of 512. Just because. What kind of reasons should I have?.. It must fit GPU and must not be too small not to have many gradient oscillations. I've optimized with Adam, because it's like a standard optimization algorithm (read \"most popular\"). Maybe RMSProp is like a close decision. About the number of iterations... I did the training once for 200 epochs, but the model didn't overfit and continued to learn, so I decided to have 400 and finally reached plateau.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the overfitting, I didn't need to handle it explicitly, because I didn't see it :). Actully, it has several reasons: I used data augmentation (that's why train score is always lower than test one) and I used dropouts from VGG, which also negates overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "P.S. in the task statement it is said to refer papers or blogs. As it was said in the beginning, I was mainly conducted by the lectures materials and some random googling of tiny ImageNet best performing arcitectures, so I don't see the need to refer something here. \n",
    "\n",
    "P.P.S ah, yeah, and you can see that I've tried to use scheduller to reduce learning rate. I even left a model to train during the night with scheduller, but it didn't learn anything and stayed on random predictions :c. I just didn't have time to cook scheduller properly."
